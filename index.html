          needed some structure from professionals, who can help me learn
          programming step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          the entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. they were
          veryhands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. the agile
          team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to
          the next level in a way that no tutorial could evere have. in fact,
          i've often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my
          developent experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomment!"
